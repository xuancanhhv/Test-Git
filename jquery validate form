jQuery Validation Plugin
This jQuery plugin makes simple clientside form validation easy, whilst still offering plenty of customization options. It makes a good choice if you’re building something new from scratch, but also when you’re trying to integrate something into an existing application with lots of existing markup. The plugin comes bundled with a useful set of validation methods, including URL and email validation, while providing an API to write your own methods. All bundled methods come with default error messages in english and translations into 37 other languages.

For a quick overview of what this plugin provides, check out this Webucator video (they also provide jQuery trainings):



The plugin was initially written and maintained by Jörn Zaefferer, a member of the jQuery team, lead developer on the jQuery UI team and maintainer of QUnit. It was started back in the early days of jQuery in 2006, and updated and improved since then.

Starting with Version 1.15.0 Markus Staab took over the maintenance of the codebase in February 2016. Since July 2016 Brahim Arkni assisted Markus, and a few months later Brahim joined the jQuery Validation core team.
